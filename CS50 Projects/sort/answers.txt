sort1 uses: Bubble

How do you know?: Ω is Ω(n) while O(n^2) so there needs to be a diffrence when sorting reversed and sorted and there is doffrence when tested.

sort2 uses: Merge

How do you know?: According to my time chart that I made sort2 sorts the fastest by far when it gets to the big data files.

sort3 uses: Selection

How do you know?: Here Ω = O as they both are (n^2) so the timing for sorted and reversed should be the same, when checked, my assumption was confirmed.
